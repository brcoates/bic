# BIC Compiler

## Overview
Basic Instruction Compiler. The idea is to present an intermediate language that both captures the simplistic nature of assembly, but also offers a level of abstraction that both is straightforward to compile to and straightforward to work with.

Essentially this exists to act as both a target language, and source language for compiler projects.

## Compiling
To compile, run the following under a unix based system. Originally developed on OSX with CMake.
```
./configure.sh
./build.sh
```

To test, run: 
```
./configure.sh
./test.sh
```
